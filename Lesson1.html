            <ul>

                <li>Step 1: Pre-heat oven to 175Â°C</li>
                <li>Step 2: Lightly grease an 8x12-inch baking pan* with cooking oil spray. Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.</li>  
                <li>Step 3: Combine melted butter, oil and sugars together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk well to combine. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour (another minute).</li>
                <li>Step 4: Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).</li>
                <li>Step 5: Fold in 3/4 of the chocolate pieces.</li>
                <li>Step 6: Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly, and top with remaining chocolate pieces.</li>
                <li>Step 7: Bake for 25-30 minutes for just under-done brownies (fudgier texture) or until the centre of the brownies no longer jiggles and is JUST set to the touch.</li>
